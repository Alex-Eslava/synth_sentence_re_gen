# Synth Sentences Generator
I've needed to reuse this code and scale it to my needs several times in my life so I'm putting out here a barebones version of what I do to generate synthetic data when I need it. 

Templates contains the sentences that can then be filled out with Template Variables.

I'm aware this implementation has much less flair than any generative LLM would produce. 

In the shown example only a small amount of sentences are generated to serve as a simple example of how to do this.
